## Fractional knapsack

Fractional Knapsack is a classic optimization problem in computer science and combinatorial optimization. The problem involves selecting a subset of items with given values and weights to maximize the total value in a knapsack, subject to the constraint that the total weight of selected items should not exceed the knapsack's capacity.
Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack problem, in Fractional Knapsack, fractions of items can be selected, meaning that a portion of an item can be included in the knapsack.


# Performance of Fractional Knapsack

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the greedy algorithm for the Fractional Knapsack Problem can be attributed to the following main steps:

Calculating value-to-weight ratios for each item: O(n), where n is the number of items.
Sorting the items based on the value-to-weight ratio: O(n log n) if a comparison-based sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort is used.
Iterating through the sorted items and adding items to the knapsack: O(n).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n).



## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the greedy algorithm is relatively low and primarily depends on the data structures used to represent the items and the knapsack.
O(n) space is required to store the list of items.
O(n) space is needed to store the value-to-weight ratios.
Hence, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(n).



# Applications:

## Resource Allocation:
Fractional Knapsack finds applications in resource allocation scenarios, such as allocating resources with varying values and weights, where fractions of resources can be utilized.

## Financial Portfolio Optimization:
In finance, Fractional Knapsack can model the problem of selecting a portfolio of investments with varying returns and risks while staying within a budget or risk tolerance.

## Data Compression:
In data compression, Fractional Knapsack can be used to optimize the storage of files with different compression ratios, aiming to maximize the overall compression efficiency.

## Project Scheduling:
When scheduling projects with different durations and benefits, Fractional Knapsack can assist in selecting projects to maximize the overall benefit within a constrained timeframe or budget.

## Load Balancing:
In computer systems, Fractional Knapsack can be applied to load balancing, where tasks with varying computation times and benefits need to be assigned to servers to optimize overall system performance.

## Cutting Stock Problem:
In manufacturing and cutting stock problems, Fractional Knapsack can be employed to determine the optimal cutting patterns for materials to meet demand while minimizing waste.
