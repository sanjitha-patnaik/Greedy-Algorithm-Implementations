# Activity Selection Problem

Given a set of activities, each with a start time and end time, the task is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be performed. The goal is to schedule as many activities as possible without conflicting time intervals.

# Greedy Approach:

## Sort Activities by Finish Time:

Start by sorting the activities based on their finish times in ascending order.

## Select First Activity:

Select the activity with the earliest finish time as the first selected activity.

## Iterate and Select Compatible Activities:

Iterate through the sorted activities, and at each step, select the next activity whose start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity.

## Repeat Until No More Compatible Activities:

Repeat step 3 until there are no more compatible activities.


# Performance
## Time Complexity 

The time complexity of the greedy algorithm for the Activity Selection Problem is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n) if an efficient sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort or mergesort) is used. The selection of compatible activities in the subsequent iteration takes linear time, making the overall time complexity O(n log n).

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) as it requires additional space to store the activities, and the size of this storage is directly proportional to the number of activities.


# Applications:
The Activity Selection Problem and its greedy algorithm have various practical applications:


## Scheduling:
In project scheduling, when a resource can only handle one task at a time, the goal is to maximize the number of tasks completed.

## Conference Room Scheduling:
Efficiently scheduling conferences or meetings in conference rooms where multiple events are taking place.

## Processor Task Scheduling:
In operating systems, scheduling tasks on processors to maximize overall processing efficiency.

## Radio Frequency Assignment:
Assigning frequencies to transmitters to minimize interference in wireless communication networks.

## Job Scheduling:
Assigning time slots to jobs to optimize the overall throughput in job scheduling scenarios.

## Classroom Scheduling:
Scheduling classes in university or school classrooms to utilize resources efficiently.
