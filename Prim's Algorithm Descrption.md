# Prim's Algorithm:
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. The minimum spanning tree is a tree that spans all the vertices of the graph while minimizing the total edge weight. Prim's algorithm grows the minimum spanning tree incrementally by adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

# Algorithm Steps:

## Initialization:
Start with an arbitrary vertex as the initial tree.
Initialize a priority queue (heap) to store candidate edges based on their weights.

## Growing the Tree:
At each step, select the edge with the smallest weight that connects a vertex in the current tree to a vertex outside the tree.
Add the selected edge and the newly connected vertex to the tree.

## Termination:
Continue until all vertices are included in the tree, forming the minimum spanning tree.




# Time Complexity:

With an adjacency list representation of the graph and a binary heap for the priority queue, Prim's algorithm has a time complexity of O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Using more advanced data structures like Fibonacci heaps can improve the time complexity to O(E + V log V) for sparse graphs.


# Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(V + E) as it involves storing the graph's adjacency list, the priority queue, and the set of visited vertices.
